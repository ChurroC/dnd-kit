## Overview

Plugins are a powerful way to extend the core functionality of @dnd-kit. They can be used to add new features, or modify existing behavior.

Almost every non-essential feature in dnd kit is implemented as a plugin, and can be disabled or replaced. This includes sensors, modifiers and other non-vital functionality, such as:

- [Accessibility](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/blob/experimental/packages/dom/src/core/plugins/accessibility/Accessibility.ts)
- [Scroller](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/blob/experimental/packages/dom/src/core/plugins/scrolling/Scroller.ts)
- [Auto-scroller](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/blob/experimental/packages/dom/src/core/plugins/scrolling/AutoScroller.ts)
- [Feedback](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/blob/experimental/packages/dom/src/core/plugins/feedback/Feedback.ts)
- [Cursor](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/blob/experimental/packages/dom/src/core/plugins/cursor/Cursor.ts)

## API Reference

### Plugin

The `Plugin` class is the base interface for all plugins.

```ts
interface PluginOptions {
  [key: string]: any;
}

export abstract class Plugin {
  constructor(
    public manager: DragDropManager,
    public options?: PluginOptions
  ) {}

  /**
   * Whether the plugin instance is disabled.
   * Triggers effects when accessed.
   */
  public disabled: boolean = false;

  /**
   * Enable a disabled plugin instance.
   * Triggers effects.
   */
  public enable(): void;

  /**
   * Disable an enabled plugin instance.
   * Triggers effects.
   */
  public disable(): void;

  /**
   * Whether the plugin instance is disabled.
   * Does not trigger effects when accessed.
   */
  public isDisabled(): boolean;

  /**
   * Configure a plugin instance with new options.
   */
  public configure(options?: PluginOptions): void;

  /**
   * Destroy a plugin instance.
   * Each plugin is responsible for implementing its own
   * destroy method to clean up effects and listeners
   */
  public destroy(): void;

  /**
   * Configure a plugin constructor with options.
   * This method is used to configure the options that the
   * plugin constructor will use to create plugin instances.
   */
  static configure(options: PluginOptions): PluginDescriptor;
}
```
