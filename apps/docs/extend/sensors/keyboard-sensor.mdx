The Keyboard sensor responds to [Keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent). This sensor is enabled by default.

The keyboard sensor activates when the source `element` or `handle` of a draggable instance is focused and the <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is pressed.

## Usage

The Keyboard sensor can be configured to respond to different keyboard codes:

```js
import {KeyboardSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

const sensors = [
  KeyboardSensor.configure({
    keyboardCodes: {
      start: ['Space', 'Enter'],
      cancel: ['Escape'],
      end: ['Space', 'Enter'],
      up: ['ArrowUp'],
      down: ['ArrowDown'],
      left: ['ArrowLeft'],
      right: ['ArrowRight'],
    },
  }),
];
```
