## Installation
Before getting started, make sure you install `@dnd-kit/dom` in your project.

<CodeGroup>
  ```plain npm
  npm install @dnd-kit/dom
  ```

  ```plain yarn
  yarn install @dnd-kit/dom
  ```

  ```plain pnpm
  pnpm install @dnd-kit/dom
  ```

  ```plain bun
  bun install @dnd-kit/dom

## Creating a draggable element

Let's get started by creating draggable elements that can be dropped over droppable targets.

In this example, we'll be using the Draggable class to create a draggable element. The Draggable class requires an element and an id as arguments.
We'll also need to create a DragDropManager instance to manage the drag and drop interactions.

```tsx
import {DragDropManager, Draggable} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager();
const element = document.createElement('button');
const draggable = new Draggable({
  element,
  id: 'draggable',
}, manager);

document.body.appendChild(element);
```

## Creating droppable elements

In order for our draggable elements to have targets where they can be dropped, we need to create droppable elements. To do so, weâ€™ll be using the useDroppable hook.

Like the useDraggable hook, the useDroppable hook requires a unique id, and returns a ref that you can attach to any element to make it droppable.

This time, we'll accept the id argument as a prop of the Droppable component.

```tsx
import {Droppable} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const element = document.createElement('div');
const droppable = new Droppable({
  element,
  id: 'droppable',
}, manager);

element.setAttribute('style', 'width: 300px; height: 300px; background: #FEFEFE;');

document.body.appendChild(element);
```

## Putting all the pieces together

In order to move the draggable element into the droppable target, we need to monitor the drag and drop events and update the DOM accordingly.

```tsx
manager.monitor.addEventListener('dragend', (event) => {
  if (event.canceled) {
    return;
  }

  if (event.operation.target?.id === 'droppable') {
    droppableElement.appendChild(draggableElement);
  } else {
    document.body.prependChild(draggableElement);
  }
});
```
