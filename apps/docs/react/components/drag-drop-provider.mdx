The `DragDropProvider` component is a context provider that enables drag and drop interactions within its subtree.

## Usage

### Location

- Wrap your application with the `DragDropProvider` component to enable drag and drop interactions across the entire application.

  ```jsx
  import {DragDropProvider} from '@dnd-kit/react';

  function App() {
    return (
      <DragDropProvider>
        {/* Your application */}
      </DragDropProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

- If you want to limit drag and drop interactions to a specific subtree, you can wrap only that subtree with the `DragDropProvider` component.
- You can use the `DragDropProvider` component multiple times within your application to create separate drag and drop contexts.

  ```jsx
  import {DragDropProvider} from '@dnd-kit/react';

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <DragDropProvider>
          {/* Your first drag and drop context */}
        </DragDropProvider>
        <DragDropProvider>
          {/* Your second drag and drop context */}
        </DragDropProvider>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

- You can also nest `DragDropProvider` components to create a hierarchy of drag and drop contexts.

  ```jsx
  import {DragDropProvider} from '@dnd-kit/react';

  function App() {
    return (
      <DragDropProvider>
        <div>
          <DragDropProvider>
            {/* Your draggable and droppable elements */}
          </DragDropProvider>
        </div>
      </DragDropProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

### Listening to drag and drop events

You can use the `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, `onDragOver` and `onDragEnd` event listeners to respond to drag and drop events within the subtree of the `DragDropProvider` component.

```jsx
import {DragDropProvider} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <DragDropProvider
      onDragStart={(event) => {
        console.log('Drag started:', event.source);
      }}
      onDragMove={(event) => {
        console.log('Drag moved:', event.operation.position);
      }}
      onDragOver={(event) => {
        console.log('Drag over target:', event.target);
      }}
      onDragEnd={(event) => {
        console.log('Drag ended:', event.source, event.target);
      }}
    >
      {/* Your draggable and droppable elements */}
    </DragDropProvider>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

### Props

<ParamField path="onBeforeDragStart" type="(event: BeforeDragStartEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called before a drag operation starts. Can be used to prevent the drag operation from starting by invoking `event.preventDefault()`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onDragStart" type="(event: DragStartEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called when a drag operation starts.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onDragMove" type="(event: DragMoveEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called when a draggable element is moved.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onCollision" type="(event: CollisionEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called when new collisions are detected between the draggable source and droppable targets. Invoke `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the first collision from being set as the target of the drag operation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onDragOver" type="(event: DragOverEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called when a draggable element is dragged over a droppable target.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="onDragEnd" type="(event: DragEndEvent) => void">
  A callback that is called when a drag operation ends.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="children" type="ReactNode">
  The children of the `DragDropProvider` component.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="manager" type="DragDropManager">
  An instance of the `DragDropManager` class that is used to manage the drag and drop interactions within the subtree of the `DragDropProvider` component.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="plugins" type="Plugin[]">
  An array of [plugins](/extend/plugins) that can be used to extend the functionality of the drag and drop manager.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sensors" type="Sensor[]">
  An array of [sensors](/extend/sensors) that can be used to detect user input in the browser.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modifiers" type="Modifier[]">
  An array of [modifiers](/extend/modifiers) that can be used to modify or restrict the behavior of draggable and droppable elements.
