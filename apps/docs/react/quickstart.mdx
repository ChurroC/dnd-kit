## Overview

The `@dnd-kit/react` package provides a set of React components and hooks that you can use to build drag and drop interfaces. It is thin React integration layer built on top of the [vanilla](/overview) library, so all of the same concepts are shared and can be used. You can refer to the vanilla documentation of these concepts, such as [plugins](/extend/plugins), [modifiers](/extend/modifiers), and [sensors](/extend/sensors).

## Installation
Before getting started, make sure you install `@dnd-kit/react` in your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```plain npm
  npm install @dnd-kit/react
  ```

  ```plain yarn
  yarn install @dnd-kit/react
  ```

  ```plain pnpm
  pnpm install @dnd-kit/react
  ```

  ```plain bun
  bun install @dnd-kit/react
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Making elements draggable

Let's get started by creating draggable elements that can be dropped over droppable targets. To do so, we'll be using the `useDraggable` hook.

The `useDraggable` hook requires a unique `id`, and returns a `ref` that you can attach to any element to make it draggable.

```jsx
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Draggable() {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id: 'draggable',
  });

  return (
    <button ref={ref}>
      Draggable
    </button>
  );
}
```

<Story id="react-draggable--basic-setup" />

## Creating droppable elements

In order for our draggable elements to have targets where they can be dropped, we need to create droppable elements.
To do so, we'll be using the `useDroppable` hook.

Like the `useDraggable` hook, the `useDroppable` hook requires a unique `id`, and returns a `ref` that you can attach to any element to make it droppable.

This time, we'll accept the `id` argument as a prop of the `Droppable` component.

```jsx
import {useDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Droppable({id, children}) {
  const {ref} = useDroppable({
    id,
  });

  return (
    <div ref={ref} style={{width: 300, height: 300}}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Putting all the pieces together

Now that we have both draggable and droppable elements, we can put them together to create a simple drag and drop interaction.

We'll be using the `DragDropProvider` component to wrap our draggable and droppable elements.
This component handles the drag and drop interactions between our draggable and droppable elements and allow us listen to drag and drop events.

<CodeGroup>
```jsx App.js
import {DragDropProvider} from '@dnd-kit/react';
import Draggable from './Draggable';
import Droppable from './Droppable';

function App() {
  const [isDropped, setIsDropped] = useState(false);

  return (
    <DragDropProvider
      onDragEnd={(event) => {
        if (event.canceled) return;

        const isDropped = event.target?.id === 'droppable';
        setIsDropped(isDropped);
      }}
    >
      {!isDropped && <Draggable />}

      <Droppable id="droppable">
        {isDropped && <Draggable />}
      </Droppable>
    </DragDropProvider>
  );
}
```
```jsx Draggable.js
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

export function Draggable() {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id: 'draggable',
  });

  return (
    <button ref={ref}>
      Draggable
    </button>
  );
}
```
```jsx Droppable.js
import {useDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Droppable({id, children}) {
  const {ref} = useDroppable({
    id,
  });

  return (
    <div ref={ref} style={{width: 300, height: 300}}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<div class="mt-8">
  <Story id="react-droppable--basic-setup" height="390" />
</div>

We now have a simple drag and drop interaction set up. You can now build on top of this to create more complex interactions.

For example, you can render multiple draggable elements and droppable targets, and listen to drag and drop events to move elements around.

Let's try adding more droppable targets to our example:

```jsx App.js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import {DndContext} from '@dnd-kit/core';

import {Droppable} from './Droppable';
import {Draggable} from './Draggable';

function App() {
  const targets = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
  const [target, setTarget] = useState();
  const draggable = (
    <Draggable id="draggable">Drag me</Draggable>
  );

  return (
    <DragDropProvider
      onDragEnd={(event) => {
        if (event.canceled) return;

        setTarget(event.target?.id);
      }}
    >
      {!target ? draggable : null}

      {targets.map((id) => (
        <Droppable key={id} id={id}>
          {target === id ? draggable : `Droppable ${id}`}
        </Droppable>
      ))}
    </DragDropProvider>
  );
};
```
