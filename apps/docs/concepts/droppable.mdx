## Usage

First, we'll create a new [DragDropManager](/concepts/drag-drop-manager) instance. This is the orchestrator of the drag and drop system. It manages the state of all draggable and droppable elements, and coordinates the events between them.

Then, we'll import the `Droppable` class to create droppable targets for draggable elements.

The `id` argument is required, and needs to be unique within this manager. We'll also need to supply a reference to the `element` we want to make droppable.

```js
import {Droppable, DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager();

const element = document.createElement('div');
element.style.width = '200px';
element.style.height = '200px';

const droppable = new Droppable({
  id: 'droppable',
  element,
}, manager);
```

In order for our droppable element to receive draggable elements, you'll need to create some [Draggable elements](/concepts/draggable).

## Detecting collisions

By default, the `Droppable` class uses a simple bounding box collision detection algorithm to detect collisions between the droppable element and the active draggable source element:

<img src="/images/droppable/shape-intersection.svg" />

You can customize this behavior by supplying a custom collision detector function.
The built-in collision detectors are:

- `shapeIntersection`
- `pointerIntersection`
- `closestCenter`
- `directionBiased`


For example, you can import the `closestCenter` collision detector from the `@dnd-kit/collision` package:

```js
import {Droppable, DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';
import {closestCenter} from '@dnd-kit/collision';

const manager = new DragDropManager();
const droppable = new Droppable({
  id: 'droppable',
  collisionDetector: closestCenter,
}, manager);
```

This collision detection algorithm will detect collisions based on the distance between the center of the droppable element and the center of the active draggable source element:

<img src="/images/droppable/closest-center.svg" />

### Prioritizing collisions

You can prioritize collisions between droppable elements by supplying a `collisionPriority` number to the `Droppable` class.
The higher the number, the higher the priority when detecting collisions.
This can be useful if there are multiple droppable elements that overlap, or if you want to prioritize certain droppable elements over others.

```js
import {Droppable, DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager();

const firstDroppable = new Droppable({
  id: '1',
  collisionPriority: 1,
}, manager);
const secondDroppable = new Droppable({
  id: '2',
  collisionPriority: 2,
}, manager);
```

## API Reference

### Arguments

The `Droppable` class accepts the following arguments:

<ParamField path="id" type="string | number" required>
  The identifier of the droppable element. Should be unique within the same [drag and drop context provider](/react/components/drag-drop-provider).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="element" type="Element">
  The element that should be made droppable. While this paramater is not required in the constructor, it is required to make the element droppable. You can update the `element` on the instance after creating it.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="accepts" type="string | number | Symbol | (type: string | number | Symbol) => boolean">
  Optionally supply a type of draggable element to only allow it to be dropped over certina droppable targets that [accept](#) this `type`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="collisionDetector" type="(input: CollisionDetectorInput) => Collision | null">
  Optionally supply a [collision detector](#detecting-collisions) function can be used to detect collisions between the droppable element and draggable elements.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="collisionPriority" type="number">
  Optionally supply a number to set the collision priority of the droppable element. The higher the number, the higher the priority when detecting collisions. This can be useful if there are multiple droppable elements that overlap.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="disabled" type="boolean">
  Set to `true` to prevent the droppable element from being a drop target.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="{[key: string]: any}">
  The data argument is for advanced use-cases where you may need access to additional data about the droppable element in event handlers, modifiers, sensors or custom plugins.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="effects" type="(manager: DragDropManager) => Effect[]">
  <Info>This is an advanced feature and should not need to be used by most consumers.</Info>
  You can supply a function that returns an array of reactive effects that can be set up and automatically cleaned up when invoking the `destroy()` method of this instance.
</ParamField>
