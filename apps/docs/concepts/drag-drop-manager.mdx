## Overview

As its name suggests, the `DragDropManager` is the manager of all of draggable and droppable elements, and it coordinates the events between them.

The manager is responsible for:

- Keeping track of all draggable and droppable elements.
- Firing events when elements are dragged, moved, dropped.
- Detecting collisions between draggable and droppable elements.
- Registering and unregistering [plugins](/extend/plugins) to extend the core functionality, [modifiers](/extend/modifiers) to modify the behavior of the drag and drop system, and [sensors](/extend/sensors) to detect user interactions.
- Lifecycle management to avoid any memory leaks.

## Usage

To create a new `DragDropManager` instance, you can import the `DragDropManager` class from the `@dnd-kit/dom` package.

```js
import {DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager();
```

## API Reference

### Arguments

The `DragDropManager` class accepts the following arguments:

<ParamField path="plugins" type="Plugin[]">
  An array of [plugins](/extend/plugins) that can be used to extend the core functionality of the drag and drop system.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sensors" type="Sensors[]">
  An array of [sensors](/extend/sensors) that can be bound to the draggable element to detect drag interactions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modifiers" type="Modifier[]">
  An array of [modifiers](/extend/modifiers) that can be used to modify or restrict the behavior of the draggable element.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="renderer" type="Renderer">
  The renderer option is an advanced option that allows you to connect the drag and drop system to a custom renderer, such as React or Vue. This allows the manager to await the renderer to finish rendering before firing certain events.
</ParamField>

### Instance

#### Properties

The `DragDropManager` instance exposes the following properties:

<ParamField path="actions">
  The `actions` property exposes a set of methods that can be used to interact with the drag and drop system. This includes methods to start, move, and end drag operations.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="collisionObserver">
  The `collisionObserver` property is responsible for detecting collisions between draggable and droppable elements.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="dragOperation">
  The `dragOperation` property exposes metadata about the current drag operation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="monitor">
  The `monitor` can be used to register and unregister event listeners when drag and drop events are emitted.

  The events that can be listened to are:

  | Event Name | Description | Preventable |
  | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `beforedragstart` | Fired before a drag operation is initiated. | True |
  | `dragstart` | Fired when a drag operation is initiated. | False |
  | `dragmove` | Fired when a draggable element is moved. | False |
  | `dragend` | Fired when a drag operation is ended. | True |
  | `collision` | Fired when a collision is detected between draggable and droppable elements. | True |
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="registry">
  The `registry` property is responsible for registering and unregistering [draggable](/concepts/draggable) and [droppable](/concepts/droppable) instances, along with instances of [plugins](/extend/plugins), [modifiers](/extend/modifiers), and [sensors](/extend/sensors).
</ParamField>

#### Methods

The `DragDropManager` instance exposes the following methods:

<ParamField path="destroy" type="() => void">
  The `destroy` method is used to clean up the manager and all of its associated draggable, droppable, plugins, modifiers, and sensors instances.
</ParamField>
