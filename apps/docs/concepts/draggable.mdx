## Usage


First, we'll create a new [DragDropManager](/concepts/drag-drop-manager) instance. This is the orchestrator of the drag and drop system. It manages the state of all draggable and droppable elements, and coordinates the events between them.

Then, we'll import the `Draggable` class to make elements draggable and allow them to be dropped over [droppable](/concepts/droppable) targets.

The `id` argument is required, and needs to be unique within this manager. We'll also need to supply a reference to the `element` we want to make draggable.


```js
import {Draggable, DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager();

const element = document.createElement('button');
element.innerText = 'Draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable({
  id: 'draggable',
  element,
}, manager);

document.body.appendChild(element);
```

In order to drop the draggable element over a droppable target, you'll need to create a [Droppable element](/concepts/droppable).

## API Reference

### Arguments

The `Draggable` class accepts the following arguments:

<ParamField path="id" type="string | number" required>
  The identifier of the draggable element. Should be unique within the same [drag and drop context provider](/concepts/drag-drop-provider).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string | number | Symbol">
  Optionally supply a type to only allow this draggable element to be dropped over droppable targets that [accept](/concepts/droppable) this `type`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="element" type="Element">
  The element that should be made draggable. While this paramater is not required in the constructor, it is required to make the element draggable. You can update the `element` on the instance after creating it.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="handle" type="Element">
  Optionally supply a drag handle element to restrict initiating dragging to a specific element. If not provided, the entire `element` will be draggable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="disabled" type="boolean">
  Set to `true` to prevent the draggable element from being draggable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="feedback" type="'default' | 'clone' | 'move' | 'none'">
  The type of feedback that should be displayed when the element is being dragged.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modifiers" type="Modifier[]">
  An array of [modifiers](/plugins/modifiers) that can be used to modify or restrict the behavior of the draggable element.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sensors" type="Sensors[]">
  An array of [sensors](/sensors/overview) that can be bound to the draggable element to detect drag interactions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="{[key: string]: any}">
  The data argument is for advanced use-cases where you may need access to additional data about the draggable element in event handlers, [modifiers](/extend/modifiers), [sensors](/extend/sensors) or [plugins](/extend/plugins).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="effects" type="(manager: DragDropManager) => Effect[]">
  <Info>This is an advanced feature and should not need to be used by most consumers.</Info>
  You can supply a function that returns an array of reactive effects that can be set up and automatically cleaned up when invoking the `destroy()` method of this instance.
</ParamField>
