Better handling of elements that have `transform` or `translate` applied. The Feedback and Sortable plugins now no longer need to ignore transforms as the `DOMRectangle` can compute the projected final coordinates of an element that has transforms applied even if it is currently being animated by looking at the last animation keyframe.
